          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>This project is designed to present articles and photos of Brisbane's flood history in an engaging and user-friendly way. Photos and newspaper articles are sourced from the National Library of Australia, a massive collection of Australian resources. You can view information on major flood events, or apply specific filters to find what you're looking for. </p>
            <br>
          <h3>Usage</h3>
           <p>To browse by major flood event, click one of the buttons at the top of the page. You can toggle between these timeline buttons and advanced search filters by clicking a link on the right. You can browse articles, and view the original print. You can also view photos, tagged by location on the map, by clicking a map marker. This will show a brief overview with a link to the Trove record. Clicking a photo thumbnail will display the full size image.</p>
           <br>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>This web application was created by students as part of a project at the University of Queensland, and uses the National Library of Australia's Trove API. The goal was to somehow utilise Trove records in an interesting and useful way.</p>
          
          <br>
          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>By default, 30 articles and a maximum of 100 photos are displayed for each search. The maximum number of records which can be returned by a single search is 100. To load more, click 'See more' at the bottom of the Articles list, or 'Load more photos' below the map.</p>
          <p>If no articles are returned, your search is probably too recent. Trove only contains records of articles from before 2000 (as of writing).</p>
          <p>This application will work best in a modern browser and probably won't display correctly on a mobile browser.</p>
          <!-- <p>If you're having problems with the help popups, they can be disabled via a link on the main timeline page.</p> -->
